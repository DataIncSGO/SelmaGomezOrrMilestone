# SelmaGomezOrrMilestone

This project serves as a capstone project for the Data Incubator Winter 2016 cohort.  It is based on the Data Incubator
Blog, "Painlessly Deploying Data Apps with Bokeh, Flask, and Heroku."
The app provides the closing price for the last month for the stock requested by user via the
stock ticker symbol.  The app provides no error checking for the input for stock symbol.
